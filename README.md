# BWApp-Install
Installation of the BWApp


Once installer is extracted from zip, you may need to ‘unblock’ the file by right clicking on it, go to properties, and select ‘unblock’.

Right click the installer and "run with powershell"

The Installer will prompt for you to run a command in an elevated powershell window to allow the installer to run without restriction.

Once done, there will be a shortcut on the desktop. Right click it and run with powershell to begin using it.
